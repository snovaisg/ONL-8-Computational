# Plan

1. Solve the first problem (1b) using both penalty methods - pure and Augmented Lagrangian. Here we'll have to create the optimization pipeline and iterate on it until it works. We will also create ideas here for visualization and checking convergence and other metrics that are interesting.

2. Expand what was learned from 1 to the rest of the problems.
